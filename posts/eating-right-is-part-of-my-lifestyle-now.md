**Eating right is part of Day.**

"Eating right" is a concept centered around maintaining a balanced, nutritious diet that supports overall health and well-being. This involves consuming a variety of foods in the right proportions to provide your body with essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Here are some key aspects of eating right:

Balanced Diet: A balanced diet includes a mix of different food groups:

Fruits and Vegetables: Rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Aim for a variety of colors to ensure a range of nutrients.
Proteins: Essential for building and repairing tissues. Sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and legumes.
Whole Grains: Provide energy and are a good source of fiber. Examples are brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats.
Dairy or Dairy Alternatives: Important for calcium and vitamin D. Choose low-fat or fat-free options when possible.
Fats: Necessary for overall health, but choose healthy fats such as those from avocados, nuts, and olive oil while limiting saturated and trans fats.
Portion Control: Managing portion sizes helps prevent overeating and maintains a healthy weight. Use tools like portion plates or guidelines to keep portions in check.

Hydration: Drinking enough water is crucial for bodily functions. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day, and more if you're active or in a hot climate.

Limit Sugars and Sodium: High intake of added sugars and sodium can lead to health issues like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Read labels and choose foods with lower amounts of these ingredients.

Mindful Eating: Paying attention to what and when you eat can improve digestion and help you enjoy your food more. Avoid distractions like screens while eating, and take time to savor your meals.

Regular Meals and Snacks: Eating at regular intervals helps maintain energy levels and prevents overeating. Include healthy snacks like nuts, fruits, or yogurt to keep you satisfied between meals.

Healthy Cooking Methods: Opt for methods like grilling, baking, steaming, or sautéing instead of frying to reduce added fats and calories.

Reading Labels: Understanding nutrition labels can help you make informed choices about the foods you consume, focusing on ingredients and nutritional content.
